## Emphasis

Across all _disciplines, Trent brings_ critical, integrative thinking to life every day. Popular among students is Trentâ€™s uniquely flexible learning environment where a single faculty of _arts and science_ allows students to fully customize their degree in a way that truly reflects their goals and interests.

## Strong

Trent University **offers students** the opportunity to study in more than 100 programs across two campuses. The **Peterborough campus features award-winning** architecture and innovative and academically-rigorous programs housed on 1,400 acres in a breathtaking natural setting on the banks of the Otonabee River. A second campus, Trent Durham Greater Toronto Area, is located in Oshawa and offers career-ready academic programs and experiences. A new residence and academic building opened at this growing campus in Fall 2020.
